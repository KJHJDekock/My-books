<h4>Last Adventure...</h4>
<p>In the last adventure, Courageous Rivalry, we were pledged into an adventure, which started when me and Leah were researching about a Doctor that died in a house fire in this town. We decided to find out, how he died and why all has other relatives were dying and going missing.

<p>Anyway, back to the story...</p>                                                                                                     
<p>“Now, Jay Harkin, what were you doing at the air B and B? And who if that man that was working with you? Mo, isn’t it?” questioned the police captain.</p> 
<p>Jay sat restlessly. He then fell to the ground on his knees sobbing. “I confess. I did everything! Sir, i am sorry.” he sobbed.</p>                                                        
<p>The police captain looked surprised at the sudden confession. “Did you in stuck Mo to do all he has done. In particular, lighting the junk yard, killing Caleb Harkins and sending a hacking link to some kids that were investigating in what you were doing? Because they have caught you now, that’s why you are here.” said the police captain motioning to the guard at the door to bring Mo in.The guard nodded and left the room.</p> 
<p>“Yes sir. I admit it. I also set a light to Doctor Kai’s house and i told Mo to hire a man to kill his family. But he got a little drunk with the money i gave him. And he stole from the bank and as he was driving, he drove into Doctor Kai’s family when he went over the red light. He knew it was the right car because he followed them until he stole from the bank and then he decided to then go kill them. I know cause he was on the phone telling me everything while he was driving. And i also killed Jennie Harkins and her family, when i set there house a light. And i also set Kaylie Harkin’s house alight. I just wanted that inheritance so bad!” Jay Harkin then began to sob.</p>
<p>“Jay, your penalty is death even if you don’t confess and you even try to kill me or lie, we can’t help you. You sentence will be called by the judge, but, you need to understand how much harm you have done. Mo as well, the laws of the county say if you commit a murder, the penalty in 10 years in jail. And you have killed more than 1 person, needn’t I saw, your own wife? And guess who stopped you.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “I don’t know.”                                                                                                                                                                                                      “Courageous Academy.”
