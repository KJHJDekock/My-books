<h1>Sarah’s Diary</h1> 
<h2>By Katelyn-Joy De Kock</h2>  
<p>Dear readers,
This book may not be suitable for ages under 10. This book contains the following that you need to know; This book is meant for middle school kids and may be difficult for younger readers to understand.  
This is a fictional story but I just want to make it interesting and include some aspects from my life and story, even though I am a South African and not an American.                                                              This book is about a girl called Sarah Joy and her friends (Dominick, Emma, Alexis and McKinley).            I will be telling you her story using her diary. She is in middle school with her beloved friends and faces challenges with her mean older sister, Hannah Kaylie and her friend, Julie Kellie. She also has trouble with her dogs, finds out surprising news about getting a younger brother and much more. 
This book was inspired by the bestselling book series of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I believe it’s time that the girls like me, Sarah, Dominick, Alexis, Emma and McKinley get some credit and have their own version.
Join the adventure, the fun, the friendship, and much more. Are you ready? Well let’s go.
Enjoy...</p>
